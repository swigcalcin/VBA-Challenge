# VBA-challenge
Hello! I added my script for Module 2 Challenge named as VBAChallengeScript. Saved it by using VSCode.
Provided screenshots of my results for each worksheet in the excel file (2018,2019,2020).
I also added the original excel without the VBS script implemented and the excel file with the VBS script implemented.
Went to office hours, tutoring sessions, and used ASKBCS.
Thank you!
